# mongoose-fs

This documentation and demo code is a work in progress.
 
A toy implementation of MongooseJS the object modeling library for MongoDB.  This implementation uses the file system as the backing store rather than a MongoDB database.

This implementation uses the same syntax as MongooseJS but only supports a small subset of commands (CRUD). To use this module, you can refer to this documentation or MongooseJS for performing the following tasks:

 + Creating a Schema
 + Retrieving Models
 + Finding documents
 + Saving documents
 + Updating documents
 + Deleteing documents.
